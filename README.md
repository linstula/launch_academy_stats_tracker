This is the README file for the launch academy stats tracker!

This project is intented to be a fun way for Launchers to practice collaborating
on a shared project.

Originally, the idea for this project was to just track game stats for the 
Cornhole game we have at Mission Control but the idea could easily extend to 
other areas; Xbox wins/losses, number of beers consumed, hours spent at Mission
Control, average number of bathroom breaks per day... whatever.

Have fun!
