This is the Readme file for Cornhole Tracker!

This project is intended to be a fun/goofy way for Launchers in the 
May cohort of Launch Academy to practice collaborating on a project together.

The gist of the project is to create a stat tracker for the cornhole game
we have at mission control. The tracker will track individual stats for cornhole
throughout the duration of the cohort.


Stats I think are worth tracking: 

	win / loss ratio or percentage
	overall score 						(accumulated score for all games played)
	Average points per game
	individual player ranking			(need to figure out a good algorithm for ranking)
	total games played

(I'm also open to other suggestions for metrics to track but I also 
think limiting complexity is good)


Since we haven't learned how to work with databases yet, I though we could get the 
data to persist in text files as strings. We could create a profile for each
player and have each line correspond to a certain piece of data


Players would have to interact with the program while a game is 
in progress (in order to track individual scores)

This readme is a work in progress...
